For Assignment 3, the first thing that needs to be checked is that all the files (extract_words.py, words.txt, TheThreeMuskateers.txt, and group3_assignment3_pde) are in the same folder (group_18_assignment3).

Once this is checked, run extract_words.py and it will generate allwords.txt, uniquewords.txt, and wordfrequency.txt.

Then, open the a3_novelvisualization.pdf and a3_wordfrequency.pde files in the Processing shell and hit the 'play' button.  This will produce a word cloud and a scatter-plot graph.
